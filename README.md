New WCF Membership Provider!

This library extension creates a WCF wrapper around your ASP.Net membership provider. You can use most any standard ASP.Net membership provider as your underlying security. You can use this provider to easily build out web farms using a common web services security end point. (This is a beta project seems to work, but we don't haven't deployed this into a production environment). See Security documentation for details.
Project Description

ScrimpNet.Core is a library of miscellaneous utilities we have found to be useful in our real applications. Of course we might have thrown in something cool just for fun. Most of these classes and functions are nothing new or reflect some radical new thought. They are just helper functions and libraries which we found helpful from time to time.

We have tried to organize the urchins in the same categories as the .Net System and Microsoft namespaces. Of course the squirrely things might end up anywhere. We didn't create and collect ScrimpNet.Core as some science experiment or a demo or some code mash thing. We are not in the business of building framework libraries or tools. This library is in actual production systems. Thus as we find bugs (and yes there are some) or we find ways to refactor, we'll fix, fold, spindle, remove, mutilate, morph, or simply change what we want to. You are free to use the library but by doing so, you acknowledge the fact that we don't owe anything to you. 

You are looking at a library, not especially a framework. That means the classes and functions here were not necessarily built for extensibility. You might find places in the code where we think we might find it helpful to extend. So we don't forget where they were we marked those places with the //EXTENSION comment flag.

ScrimpNet.Core is currently targeted for .Net 3.5 or better. We have tried to keep the library as generic as possible but we do use Extensions and the newer thread locking mechanisms.

We hope you find these functions will help you handle some tedious tasks faster so you can focus on delivering excellent code and solving real problems.
